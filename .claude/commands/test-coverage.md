# Test Coverage

Analyze test coverage and generate missing tests.

## Steps

1. Run tests with coverage: `npm test -- --coverage` (or equivalent)
2. Analyze coverage report
3. Identify files below 80% coverage threshold
4. For each under-covered file:
   - Analyze untested code paths
   - Generate unit tests for functions
   - Generate integration tests for APIs
   - Generate E2E tests for critical flows
5. Verify new tests pass
6. Show before/after coverage metrics
7. Ensure project reaches 80%+ overall coverage

## Focus Areas

- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases (null, undefined, empty)
- Boundary conditions

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS: Optional — specific file or directory to analyze

## Usage

```
/test-coverage
/test-coverage src/services/auth.ts
